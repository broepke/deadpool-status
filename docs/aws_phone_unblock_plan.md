# AWS Phone Number Unblock Plan

## Current Status
- ✅ US_TEN_DLC_BRAND_REGISTRATION completed
- ✅ US_TEN_DLC_CAMPAIGN_REGISTRATION completed
- ✅ SIMULATOR number is Active
- ⏳ TEN_DLC phone number pending for 5 days (longer than usual 24-48 hour timeframe)

## Recommended Actions

### 1. Verify AWS Account Status
- Ensure AWS account is in good standing
- Check if there are any pending AWS support cases
- Verify spending limits are properly set
- Confirm AWS account is out of the SMS sandbox if required

### 2. AWS Support Case
Since the phone number request has been pending for 5 days (well beyond the typical 24-48 hour window), open an AWS Support case:

1. Go to AWS Support Center
2. Create a new case with:
   - Service: SNS
   - Category: 10DLC Registration
   - Severity: Normal
   - Subject: "10DLC Phone Number Request Pending for 5 Days"
   - Description:
     ```
     - Brand registration completed successfully
     - Campaign registration completed successfully (Transactional/Account notifications)
     - Phone number request submitted 5 days ago
     - Request status still showing as pending
     - Need assistance in understanding the delay and any required actions
     ```

### 3. Alternative Approaches
While waiting for the support case:

1. **Try New Number Request**
   - Consider canceling the current pending request
   - Submit a new phone number request
   - Sometimes a fresh request can bypass potential stuck states

2. **Temporary Solution**
   - Continue using the SIMULATOR number for testing
   - Document any testing results for AWS support if needed

### 4. Monitoring
- Keep track of the AWS Support case
- Monitor AWS SNS console for status changes
- Document any error messages or status changes

## Long-term Recommendations

1. **Redundancy Planning**
   - Request multiple phone numbers once unblocked
   - Implement number rotation strategy
   - Consider fallback notification methods

2. **Documentation Updates**
   - Document the resolution process
   - Update sns_setup.md with any learned troubleshooting steps
   - Add monitoring for phone number status

## Next Steps

1. Open AWS Support case immediately
2. While waiting for response:
   - Verify all AWS account settings
   - Consider submitting a fresh number request
   - Continue development/testing with SIMULATOR number
